//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let sciFiMovies = ['interstellar', 'gravity', 'the martian'];

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = sciFiMovies[0];

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let sciFiMoviesLength = sciFiMovies.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastMovie = sciFiMovies[-1];
