I joined a yoga organization that works with under privelege youth.
During my time there I leaned further into my interests in computer technology
enough to build a website for my organization to help build the nonprofits online presence.
Since then I have continued to contribute to open source projects and tech communities.
Now I am looking to utilize my talents to a larger software engineering role and I'm looking forward
to seeing where I can contribute to your company.
