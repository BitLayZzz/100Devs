Alex is a passionate software engineer and internet privacy advocate that is on a mission to help make the internet
a safer experience for all of its users. 
His interests in technology exponentially grew late in his undergraduate years after patching a video game that brought back many memories.
Years later he is now a full fledged software engineer that's currently focused on building robust web applications for all of his clients.
When he isn't working on his projects, you'll find him online writing about what he discovers going down the cyber security rabbit hole.
Time away from his computer is well spent with friends and family playing music or dancing, as well as teaching yoga to the kids in his community.
